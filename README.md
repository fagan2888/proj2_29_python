# Project 2
Implementation of Dijkstra Algorithm on point and rigid robot,

## Description
- Check the feasibility of all inputs/outputs (if user gives start and goal nodes that are in the obstacle space they should be informed by a message and they should try again).
- Implement Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to find a path between start and end point on a given map for a point robot (radius = 0; clearance = 0) and for a rigid robot (radius = r; clearance = c)
- Your code must output an animation of optimal path generation between start and goal point on the map. You need to show both the node exploration as well as the optimal path generated. (Some useful tools for simulation are OpenCV/Pygame/Matplotlib)
